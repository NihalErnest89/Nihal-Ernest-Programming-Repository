    This class outlines the structure of a search problem.
    Any search problem will need to provide answers to the following questions:
    ```
    Where should the search start?
    Is this state a goal?
    What moves are possible from this state?
    How much did it cost to perform these action?
    ```

    The answers to these questions are provided by implementing
    the abstract methods in this class.

    Note that all the states passed into a `SearchProblem` are also generated
    by the same `SearchProblem`.
    `SearchProblem.startingState` and `SearchProblem.successorStates` produce
    states,
    while `SearchProblem.isGoal` and `SearchProblem.actionsCost` evaluate
    those same states and actions.
